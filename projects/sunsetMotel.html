<p>A corporate CEO awakens from a routine surgery gone awry to find himself in a world far different from the one he remembers. The coma he endured spared him the experience of cataclysmic events; now, the life he knew and many of the people in it, are gone. A small medical and security staff, assigned to care for this important man, must help him come to terms with losses greater than anyone should be asked to endure. Sunset Motel is a character study of how people react to one another when one another are nearly all that remain.
